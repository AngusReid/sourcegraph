            <p>Sourcegraph uses a high-performance RPC framework called <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> to provide API access, this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generated libraries for over over <a href="{{$.Ctx.BaseURL}}libraries">ten languages</a> can be used to access the Sourcegraph API!</li>
                <li>The entire API is described generic and simple <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">Protobuf</a> files.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information about gRPC check out the <a href="http://www.grpc.io/faq/">gRPC FAQ</a>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately gRPC cannot yet be used in browser-based applications due to technical limitations. For this reason the Sourcegraph API is also available as a first-class HTTP/1.1 RESTful JSON API.</p>
            <p>The RESTful JSON API is actually mapped right onto the very same high-performance gRPC API using a project called <a href="https://github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway">grpc-gateway</a>.</p>

            <p>The usage of two different APIs (gRPC and REST) means that in the documentation is structures as such:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Broken into services, messages, and enumerations (these are gRPC/Protobuf concepts).</li>
                <li>How these gRPC concepts apply to the REST API (the HTTP URL, method, it's fields, etc).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember that you can always view documentation specific to your languages API library (i.e. <em>code</em> rather than <em>concepts</em>) by clicking on the documentation link provided on the language-specific library.</p>
            <p>Once you get started, you'll see that the documentation is very nice! To dive in just click on a service that sounds interesting on the right!</p>
