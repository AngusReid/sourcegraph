            <p>Sourcegraph uses a high-performance RPC framework called <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> to provide API access, this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generated libraries for over over <a href="{{$.Ctx.BaseURL}}libraries">ten languages</a> can be used to access the Sourcegraph API!</li>
                <li>The entire API is described generic and simple <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">Protobuf</a> files.</li>

            <p>Unfortunately gRPC cannot yet be used in browser-based applications due to technical limitations. For this reason the Sourcegraph API is also available as a first-class HTTP/1.1 RESTful JSON API.</p>
            <p>The RESTful JSON API is actually mapped right onto the very same high-performance gRPC API using a project called <a href="https://github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway">grpc-gateway</a>.</p>
