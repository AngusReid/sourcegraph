Setting up Sourcegraph for your team takes 5 minutes with our cloud install scripts.

Choose your cloud provider of choice:

* [Digital Ocean]({{< relref "install/digital-ocean.md" >}})
* [AWS]({{< relref "install/amazon-ec2.md" >}})
* [Google Cloud Platform]({{< relref "install/google-cloud-platform.md" >}})

Once your cloud VM is provisioned, navigate your browser to the instance's
external IP address to register your Sourcegraph server. The first user
will automatically become the server admin. (So make sure to register
your server before sharing a link with teammates!)
