# Team Setup

Setting up Sourcegraph for your team takes 5 minutes.

## 1. Choose your cloud provider

Follow instructions for deploying Sourcegraph to your cloud provider of choice:

* [Digital Ocean]({{< relref "deploy/digital-ocean.md" >}})
* [AWS]({{< relref "deploy/amazon-ec2.md" >}})
* [Google Cloud Platform]({{< relref "deploy/google-cloud-platform.md" >}})

## 2. Enjoy

Once your cloud VM is provisioned, navigate your browser to the instance's
external IP address to register your Sourcegraph server. The first user
will automatically become the server admin. (So make sure to register
your server before sharing a link with teammates!)
