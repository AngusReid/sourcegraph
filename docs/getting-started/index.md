Sourcegraph is the intelligent, hackable code host for teams. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOdh3-QJSzs" target="_blank">Watch the
demo video</a> or browse around this server---it's a live Sourcegraph instance!

Setting up Sourcegraph for your team takes 10 minutes.

### 1. Choose your cloud provider

Follow the instructions for deploying Sourcegraph to your cloud provider of choice:

* [Digital Ocean]({{< relref "deploy/digital-ocean.md" >}})
* [AWS]({{< relref "deploy/amazon-ec2.md" >}})
* [Google Cloud Platform]({{< relref "deploy/google-cloud-platform.md" >}})

### 2. Enjoy

Once your cloud VM is provisioned, navigate your browser to the instance's
external IP address to register your Sourcegraph server. The first user
will automatically become the server admin. (So make sure to register
your server before sharing a link with teammates!)
